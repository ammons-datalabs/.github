### What We Do
We design and deploy solutions that combine deep technical foundations with practical AI engineering:

- **AI & Data Engineering Consulting** — building high-throughput data pipelines and intelligent workflows.
- **Cloud Architecture & Modernisation** — designing scalable, secure systems on Azure and AWS.
- **Agentic Workflow Automation** — integrating **FastAPI**, **DSPy**, **Langfuse**, and **DeepEval** for robust, observable AI services.
- **Encrypted Deduplication Systems** — advancing the science of scalable, privacy-preserving data protection.

We specialise in turning complex technical ideas into practical, measurable outcomes.
